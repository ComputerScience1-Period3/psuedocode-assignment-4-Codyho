Uno
//rules
The first player is normally the player to the left of the dealer and gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction.

Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.

You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action.

    	If the player has no matches, or they choose not to play any of their cards:
		They must draw a card from the Draw pile.

		If you must draw: 
   			If a card that matches is drawn: 
				The player can discard it.
		
   			If a card that doesn't match is drawn:
				The play passes on to the next player.

The game continues until a player has one card left. 

If a player has just one card: 
	They must yell “UNO!”. 
	
 	  If they are caught not saying “Uno” by another player before any card has been played:
		The player must draw two new cards. 

Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over, points are scored, and the game begins over again.
